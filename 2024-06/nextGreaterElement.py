# The next greater element of some element x in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of x in the same array.

# You are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is a subset of nums2.

# For each 0 <= i < nums1.length, find the index j such that nums1[i] == nums2[j] and determine the next greater element of nums2[j] in nums2. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is -1.

# Return an array ans of length nums1.length such that ans[i] is the next greater element as described above.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
# Output: [-1,3,-1]
# Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
# - 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
# - 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.
# - 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
# Example 2:

# Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]
# Output: [3,-1]
# Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
# - 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.
# - 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= nums1.length <= nums2.length <= 1000
# 0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 104
# All integers in nums1 and nums2 are unique.
# All the integers of nums1 also appear in nums2.
 

# Follow up: Could you find an O(nums1.length + nums2.length) solution?


class Solution:
  def nextGreaterElement(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
      result = [-1] * len(nums1)  # Initialize result with -1 for not found

      # Build a monotonic decreasing stack

              popped = stack.pop()
              # Find index of popped element in nums1 and update result
              for j in range(len(nums1)):
                  if nums1[j] == popped:
                      result[j] = nums2[i]
                      break
          stack.append(nums2[i])

      return result
