# Hint
# You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

# Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

 

# Example 1:

# Input: n = 2
# Output: 2
# Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
# 1. 1 step + 1 step
# 2. 2 steps
# Example 2:

# Input: n = 3
# Output: 3
# Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
# 1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
# 2. 1 step + 2 steps
# 3. 2 steps + 1 step
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= n <= 45

class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        sqrt_5 = 5 ** 0.5
        fib_n = int(((1 + sqrt_5) / 2)**(n + 1) / sqrt_5 + 0.5)
        return fib_n
