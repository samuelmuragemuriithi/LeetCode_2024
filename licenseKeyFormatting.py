# 482. License Key Formatting

# You are given a license key represented as a string s that consists of only alphanumeric characters and dashes. The string is separated into n + 1 groups by n dashes. You are also given an integer k.

# We want to reformat the string s such that each group contains exactly k characters, except for the first group, which could be shorter than k but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups, and you should convert all lowercase letters to uppercase.

# Return the reformatted license key.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", k = 4
# Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"
# Explanation: The string s has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters.
# Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "2-5g-3-J", k = 2
# Output: "2-5G-3J"
# Explanation: The string s has been split into three parts, each part has 2 characters except the first part as it could be shorter as mentioned above.
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length <= 105
# s consists of English letters, digits, and dashes '-'.
# 1 <= k <= 104

class Solution:
    def licenseKeyFormatting(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        # Step 1: Remove all dashes and convert to uppercase
        s = s.replace('-', '').upper()
        
        # Step 2: Initialize an empty list to hold the groups
        groups = []
        
        # Step 3: Create the groups of si ze `k` starting from the end
        while len(s) > k:
            groups.append(s[-k:])  # Take the last k characters
            s = s[:-k]             # Remove the last k characters from s
        
        # Step 4: Add the remaining characters as the first group
        groups.append(s)
        
        # Step 5: Reverse the groups (because we started from the end) and join with dashes
        return '-'.join(groups[::-1])

# Example usage:
sol = Solution()
print(sol.licenseKeyFormatting("5F3Z-2e-9-w", 4))  # Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"
print(sol.licenseKeyFormatting("2-5g-3-J", 2))     # Output: "2-5G-3J"
